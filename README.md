Here, first data preprocessing is done. In this data preprocessing section, it is seen that where the missing data are present and where the categorical data are present.
for those missing data, some data are provided by simple imputer class and for changing categorical data to numeric data LabelEncoder class is used. 
Then so many missing data are removed. After that a pair plolts of the dataset are seen to know the relation between the variables(features).
After preprocessing the dataset different types of classification models are used to fit the dataset and for further predictions.
Among those models random Forest classification model is the best fitted as well as most accurate for this dataset.The accuracy is 97.2% and the r-Square value 
is 0.88
